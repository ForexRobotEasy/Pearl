## Product Description

The Pearl Forex Software is an expert advisor designed to automate Forex trading using a grid strategy. It is developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team and is aimed at traders who want to take advantage of market reversals.

This expert advisor utilizes a grid strategy to open trades based on market analysis. It performs comprehensive Forex market analysis and checks if the code aligns with the overall D1-trend. If the trend is positive and volatility is below a threshold, trades are opened using the grid strategy.

The grid strategy involves calculating grid levels and opening trades at each level. The software calculates grid levels based on a defined grid distance and maximum grid levels. It then iterates through each grid level and checks if the price surpasses the level and if volatility remains high. If these conditions are met, a trade is opened at the current grid level.

To manage trade parameters, the software uses the Trade class from the Trade.mqh library. It sets the trade type as pending and defines the symbol and lot size. The Expert class from the Expert.mqh library is used to create an instance of the expert advisor with the name 'Pearl'. The Grid class from the Grid.mqh library is utilized to manage grid parameters, such as distance and maximum levels. The Martingale class from the Martingale.mqh library is used to increase lot size using a martingale strategy.

The software also includes functions to get the D1-trend and volatility of the Forex market. These functions can be implemented based on specific logic. The D1-trend function returns a value of 1 for an uptrend and -1 for a downtrend. The volatility function returns the volatility value of the market.

The software handles deinitialization using the OnDeinit function, which closes all open trades and outputs the reason for deinitialization.
